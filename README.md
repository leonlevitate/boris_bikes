# Boris Bikes

This simple program emulates some of the elements of the Boris Bikes Cycle Hire Scheme, for example docking stations, and releasing bikes.

## Approach

For this onsite project at Makers, I have used TDD to build my program in Ruby, using RSpec as my testing framework. To separate the concerns, I created two main classes: bike & docking_station.

## How to install

```
git clone {URL}
```

```
bundle install
```

## Run Tests

```
rspec
```
